I'm a developer with experience in a variety of frontend and backend technologies. I have experience with Java, JS, HTML, CSS, Python, and other languages. I like to design frontend following Google's Material guidelines. On the backend, I usually use Node and Pterodactyl to build and deploy applications.

I often build random web applications. I usually use just plain HTML, CSS, and JS with some frameworks but I do have experience building Svelte and React apps. I've been programming for 3 years with my roots planted in JS. I'm most experienced in Java though, and I use it to build Spigot and Paper plugins.
